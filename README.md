# Analyse-Neuron-and-mitochondria

The project is about the role of the cytoskeletal protein Wdr47 in cortical development. One of the phenotypes of the KO mouse is increased neuronal death in developing cortex, so one of the mechanisms leading to this phenotype is thought to be related to mitochondria. this project consist in the morphologic analysis of mitochondria in order to see parameters that tell something about their health, such as fragmentation (seen by the area and lenght) and number (that could account by their transport).

The protocol followed:
*Neuronal culture at E15 and transfection with scarlett plasmid.

*At day in vitro 6, transfect with mitotracker green in pre-warmed media, then take dishes to the Nikon-PSF-E1036 after washing with pre-warmed media.

*Localize neurons positive for scarlet plasmid in which the axon is identifiable. Localize the medial part of the axon (aprox 200 µm away from the soma) and take pictures in the Nikon spinning disk microscope. I used the 100x oil objective and took aprox 10 slices of 0.2 µm/slice. Laser 27% for the red, 58% for the green. Exposition: 200 ms for the gren, 100 ms for the red.
